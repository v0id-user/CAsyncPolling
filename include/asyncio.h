/*
This header file defines functions that are compatible with asynchronous programming. 
One of the key functions included is `async_sleep`, which allows for non-blocking sleep 
operations. Unlike traditional sleep functions that halt the entire thread, 
`async_sleep` enables other tasks to continue executing while waiting, thus 
maintaining the responsiveness of the application.
