# Thoughts
An unordered place for my thoughts.

## Why I want to do this?
As I said on multiple places, I want to sharpen my C skills and learn how to do things in a simple way.

## Inspiration and motivation
I watched [Tsoding | I made Futures from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNHzizPu7yQ) and [Tsoding | Async vs Multithreading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGv5WYYmyfo) and I was like "I want to do this in C".

I did not watch the full videos of Tsoding, but I did watch the first half of each video, and I grasped the idea of how to do it.
The idea is relativly simple, you need an array of functions that you call each one after the other. In round robin fashion. So I
need to save the state and this might be a problem. In [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) I have some ideas of how to do it. I said that I may 
save the EIP and ESP stack and registers, but talk is cheap how will I do it?

I will try to find some resources and will document my progress here.
